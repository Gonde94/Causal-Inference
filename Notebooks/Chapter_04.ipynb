    "Graphs are more than just a visualisation tool from a causal point of view. They can be defined in multiple ways. You can think of them as discrete mathematical structures, abstract representations of real-world entities and relations between them, or computational data structures. What these perspectives have in common are the basic building blocks of graphs: <b>nodes</b> (vertices) and <b>edges</b> (links) that connect the nodes."
