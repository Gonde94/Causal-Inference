Using association, we can answer questions about how seeing one thing changes our belief about another thing. E.g. how observing a successful product launch changes our belief that the company's stock price will go up.\n",
    "2. <u><b>Intervention</b></u>: We can intervene on one variable to check how it influences some other variable. E.g. if I go to bed earlier, will I have more energy the following morning. \n",
    "3. <u><b>Counterfactual reasoning</b></u>: Imagining/understanding. What would have happened had we done something differently. E.g. would I have made it to the office on time, had I taken the train rather than the car?"
